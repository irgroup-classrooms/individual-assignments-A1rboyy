    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: Many of these datasets can be directly loaded from data science packages, e.g., sklearn or seaborn. There is no need to download the datasets with your own scripts from the original source or somewhere else.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Iris Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:** The Iris dataset is one of the most famous datasets in machine learning. It contains measurements of iris flowers from three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Cases:** It is often used for classification tasks, particularly for demonstrating algorithms like k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), decision trees, and support vector machines (SVM).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Size:** The dataset consists of 150 samples, with 50 samples for each species.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source:** https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Titanic Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:** The Titanic dataset contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not. Features include passenger class, sex, age, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, fare paid, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Cases:** This dataset is commonly used for binary classification tasks, such as predicting survival based on various features. It is also useful for demonstrating data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Size:** The dataset contains 891 entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source:** https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&id=40945&status=active\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Wine Quality Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:** The Wine Quality dataset contains information about red and white wines from Portugal. It includes various physicochemical tests (e.g., acidity, sugar, pH, alcohol content) and a quality score (ranging from 0 to 10) assigned by wine experts. The dataset is divided into two parts: one for red wine and one for white wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Cases:** This dataset is typically used for regression tasks (predicting the quality score) and classification tasks (classifying wines into quality categories). It is useful for demonstrating regression algorithms, classification algorithms, and techniques for handling imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Size:** The red wine dataset contains 1,599 samples, while the white wine dataset contains 4,898 samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source:** https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality\n",
    "\n",
    "### (4. MNIST Dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:** The MNIST dataset is a large collection of handwritten digits (0-9) that is widely used for training various image processing systems. It consists of grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels, along with their corresponding labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Cases:** This dataset is primarily used for image classification tasks and is a standard benchmark for evaluating machine learning algorithms, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Size:** The dataset contains 70,000 images, with 60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source:** https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (5. Boston Housing Dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:** The Boston Housing dataset contains information about housing values in suburbs of Boston. It includes features such as the number of rooms, crime rate, property tax rate, and distance to employment centers, among others. The target variable is the median value of owner-occupied homes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Cases:** This dataset is typically used for regression tasks, where the goal is to predict housing prices based on the features. It is often used to demonstrate linear regression and other regression algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Size:** The dataset consists of 506 samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source:** https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/boston/bostonDetail.html\n",
    "\n",
    "**WARNING:** This dataset has ethical problems and some packages do not support their use anymore. For instance: https://scikit-learn.org/1.0/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html This dataset is included in this overview to make you aware of this issue, as this dataset is quite popular.\n",
    "\n",
    "_(In the following, we will focus on the first three datasets. The MNIST dataset is used for image classification tasks and is slightly out of scope. However, it might be useful to know about this dataset at some point in the future. **The use of the Boston Housing Dataset is also not recommended.**)_\n"
